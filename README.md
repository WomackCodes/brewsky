### _Getting started:_

This goal for this app was to build something that allowed users to both find breweries in the United States and promote a social atmosphere on the site via the ability to leave comments and favorite breweries.  There are CRUD operations to leave comments or pin breweries to the favorites page, and these features are reserved for logged in users that have signed up via Django's built in authorization.


### _Technologies Used:_ 

* Python
* Django
* HTML
* CSS
* Django Auth 
* Heroku (for deployment of app)
* 3rd party API's for location and brewery data
    * Google Maps API for location data
    * OpenBreweryDB for brewery data
* Git VCS

### _Resources Used:_

* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jYTzdxB0/project-3-breweries) for organization of productivity flow
* [Heroku](https://brewsky-jjc.herokuapp.com/) to create link to the app for deployment
* [GitHub](https://github.com/WomackCodes/brewsky) for repositories and storage of data

### Next Steps - Future Improvements: 

* Integrate either another brewery/beer API that is more robust or find a new one tht allows for beers to be pulled commented on

* Uploading of photos taken at breweries

* Further features for logged in users 

* Creation of badges or awards for users who log in at multiple breweries and upload photos
